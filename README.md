# Javascript - Save the Universe Game
Save the Universe Game in console.log

# Description
Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Assembly, on a mission to
destroy every last alien ship. Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.
There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they
will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you
have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack
the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

This game is to be designed in the console, meaning you should use console.log to display the
sequence of events
